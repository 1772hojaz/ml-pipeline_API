# 🧠 Lung Disease Prediction API (FastAPI + Docker)

This is a backend API built with **FastAPI** to support a lung disease prediction app. It uses a trained deep learning model (e.g., CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into multiple lung diseases and supports uploading data and retraining the model. This backend is containerized with Docker.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predict lung disease from chest X-ray image
- ⬆️ Upload new training data (images)
- 🔁 Trigger model retraining
- 📊 Get model performance metrics after retraining
- 🔒 CORS enabled for local frontend development

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** for REST API
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for ML model
- **Uvicorn** ASGI server
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Python 3.8+**

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1772hojaz/ml-pipeline_API.git
  cd lung-disease-api
  ```

2. Build Docker image
  ```bash
    docker build -t lung-api .
  ```
3. Run the container
  ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 lung-api
```
The API will be accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:8000
